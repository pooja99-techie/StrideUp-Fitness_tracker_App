StrideUp: Take steps towards a better you

# Problem Statement
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is a major challenge due to busy schedules, lack of proper tracking tools, and inconsistent motivation. Many individuals struggle with monitoring their daily steps, calorie intake, workout routines, and hydration levels, leading to an unhealthy lifestyle. The lack of a unified, user-friendly application that integrates all these aspects further complicates the problem.

# Why This Project?
The increasing awareness of fitness and well-being, coupled with the rise of smart health-tracking technologies, makes this project highly relevant. The app leverages real-time data through Google Fit API and Apple HealthKit to provide an efficient and interactive health monitoring solution. With advancements in AI, fitness tracking apps are now more personalized and accessible, making them essential tools in modern health management.

Several fitness-tracking apps exist, such as Google Fit, MyFitnessPal, and Fitbit. However, most of them lack a holistic approach that integrates step tracking, workout routines, diet planning, and 
hydration tracking in a single platform. Existing apps also fail to provide AI-based insights, smart hydration reminders, and seamless social integration to keep users motivated.


# Objectives and Scope of the Project
## Objectives:
	- To develop a cross-platform fitness tracking application that monitors steps, 
 	calories burned, workout routines, diet, and water intake.
	- To integrate Google Fit API and Apple HealthKit for real-time fitness data.
 	- To provide AI-based insights and recommendations to improve fitness habits.
  	- To implement social sharing and community features to keep users engaged.

## Scope:
	- Suitable for individuals looking to maintain or improve their fitness.
	- Scalable for future AI-based health monitoring features.
	- Can be integrated with wearable devices in future updates.
	- Potential commercial application for fitness brands and gyms.

# Analysis, Design, Development & Testing Methodology
## Analysis:
	- Study existing fitness apps and identify gaps.
	- Collect user requirements through surveys.
	- Define core functionalities and technical requirements.

## Design:
	- UI/UX wireframing using Figma.
	- Database design with Firebase Firestore/MySQL.
	- API interaction and modular app architecture.

## Development:
	- Frontend: Flutter (cross-platform)
	- Backend: Node.js / Firebase.
	- Database: Firebase Firestore / MongoDB
	- APIs: Google Fit API, Apple HealthKit, OpenWeather API (for hydration reminders).

## Testing Methodology:
	- Unit Testing: Testing each module separately.
	- Integration Testing: Verifying API integration with fitness data.
	- User Testing: Conducting beta tests with real users.
	- Performance Testing: Ensuring app responsiveness under different loads.

# Hardware & Software Requirements
## Hardware:
	- Smartphone (Android/iOS) with fitness sensors.
	- Server (for backend deployment if needed).
	- Wearable device (for future enhancements).

## Software:
	- Android Studio / VS Code.
	- Firebase SDK / Node.js.
	- Google Fit API / Apple HealthKit.
	- OpenWeather API.

## Testing Technologies to be Used
	- JUnit / Mockito (for unit testing of app components).
	- Postman (for API testing and debugging).
	- Firebase Test Lab (for device compatibility testing).
	- Selenium / Appium (for UI testing of mobile app).

# Contribution / Value Addition of the Project
	- Holistic Fitness Management: Unlike existing apps, this app integrates workout tracking, diet planning, 
 	hydration monitoring, and social engagement in a single platform.
	- AI-based Insights: The app provides personalized recommendations to users, improving their fitness habits.
	- Community Motivation: Users can challenge friends and share progress, increasing long-term engagement.
	- Portfolio Enhancement: This project showcases real-world API integration, making it a strong addition 
 	for job interviews and career growth.

# Limitations / Constraints
	- Limited Wearable Support: Initial version relies on Google Fit/HealthKit; direct support for fitness 
 	bands may require additional integration.
 	- Internet Dependency: Some features, such as AI-based insights and social sharing, require an active 
  	internet connection.
  	- Data Accuracy: The app relies on third-party APIs, so accuracy depends on the sensors of the userâ€™s 
   	device.

# Conclusion & Future Scope for Modification
## Conclusion:
StrideUp is a feature-rich application aimed at improving users' health and fitness by providing real-time tracking, AI-based insights, and social motivation. The use of Google Fit API and Apple HealthKit ensures reliable data collection, while smart reminders and gamification elements help users stay consistent in their fitness journey.

## Future Scope:
	- Machine Learning Integration: Advanced health insights and predictive fitness trends.
	- Wearable Device Expansion: Support for Fitbit, Garmin, and other smartwatches.
	- Voice Assistant Integration: Google Assistant or Siri commands for logging activities.
	- Corporate Wellness Programs: Adaptation for enterprise use in fitness-oriented corporate environments.
